# Toy_Shell
A small toy shell that was orginated by Stephen Brennan however I added functions setShellName, setTerminator, setNewNames, listNewNames, saveNewNames, and Stop. I'll add more Descipition in this README file

setShellName - add whatever name you desire but the default is 'myshell'
setTerminator - add whatever terminator you wish, default is '<'
listNewNames - list all current new names the user created
saveNewNames - save the new names created into a file you name
Stop- to stop executing the program
